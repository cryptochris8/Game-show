  constructor(
    message: string,
    public code: string,
    public context?: Record<string, any>
  ) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'GameError';
  }
}

// Implement comprehensive error boundaries
try {
  await this.handlePlayerAction(action);
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof GameError) {
    this.handleGameError(error);
  } else {
    this.handleUnexpectedError(error);
  }
}
```

#### 2. **State Management Enhancement**
```typescript
// Implement Redux-like state management for complex game state
interface GameState {
  readonly phase: GamePhase;
  readonly players: ReadonlyMap<string, PlayerData>;
  readonly currentQuestion: Readonly<QuestionData> | null;
}

class GameStateManager {
  private state: GameState;
  private reducer(state: GameState, action: GameAction): GameState {
    // Immutable state updates
  }
}
```

#### 3. **Performance Monitoring**
```typescript
class PerformanceMonitor {
  private metrics = new Map<string, number[]>();

  measureAsync<T>(label: string, fn: () => Promise<T>): Promise<T> {
    const start = performance.now();
    return fn().finally(() => {
      const duration = performance.now() - start;
      this.recordMetric(label, duration);
    });
  }
}
```

### **UI/UX Enhancements**

#### 1. **Advanced Animations**
```css
/* Sophisticated animations for better game feel */
.question-modal {
  animation: modalEntrance 0.8s cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1);
}

@keyframes modalEntrance {
  0% {
    transform: scale(0) rotate(180deg);
    opacity: 0;
  }
  100% {
    transform: scale(1) rotate(0deg);
    opacity: 1;
  }
}

.buzz-button {
  transition: all 0.1s ease;
}

.buzz-button:active {
  transform: scale(0.95);
  box-shadow: inset 0 0 20px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);
}
```

#### 2. **Accessibility Improvements**
```html
<!-- Enhanced accessibility -->
<button
  class="clue-cell"
  aria-label="Category: Science, Value: $200, Question not yet revealed"
  aria-describedby="game-instructions"
  tabindex="0"
>
  $200
</button>

<div id="game-instructions" class="sr-only">
