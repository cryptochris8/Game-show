### Creating Question Packs

Question packs use JSON format with validation:

```json
{
  "packId": "my-custom-pack",
  "title": "My Trivia Pack",
  "categories": [
    {
      "name": "CATEGORY NAME",
      "clues": [
        {
          "value": 100,
          "clue": "This is the clue text.",
          "answer": "What is the answer?"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "dailyDoubles": [
    { "category": 1, "index": 3 }
  ],
  "finalRound": {
    "category": "FINAL CATEGORY",
    "clue": "Final Round clue text.",
    "answer": "What is the final answer?"
  }
}
```

### Pack Validation Rules
- Must have exactly 6 categories
- Each category needs exactly 5 clues
- Standard values: 100, 200, 300, 400, 500
- 1-3 Daily Doubles recommended
- All fields required and validated

### Game Configuration

Modify GameManager initialization in `index.ts`:

```typescript
const gameManager = new GameManager(world, {
  packName: 'my-custom-pack',  // Custom question pack
  autoStart: true,             // Auto-start when min players join
  autoHostDelay: 15000,        // Delay before auto-start (ms)
  hostPlayerId: 'player-id'    // Force specific host (optional)
});
```

   - Test full game flow with 2+ human players
6. Verify all features work with Node.js/NPM environment

### Single Player Mode Commands
```bash
/singleplayer          # Start with 3 AI opponents
/singleplayer 5        # Start with 5 AI opponents
/singleplayer 1        # Start with 1 AI opponent

npm --version   # Should be >=8.0.0

# Verify no Bun installation
which bun || echo "Bun not found - good!"
```
